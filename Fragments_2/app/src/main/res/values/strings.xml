    <string name="BlackSeaText">The Black Sea is a wonderful creation of nature. It is one of the youngest seas on the planet,
        so it is still in the process of change. Imperceptibly to the human eye, every century the Black Sea recaptures 20-25 inches from land.
        The Greek cities once built on its shores had already disappeared under the water. Earlier, at the dawn of human civilization,
        the Black Sea has been so quiet and darkened its water during bad weather. Perhaps, this is how it got its present name.
        Scientists argue about this, but a consensus was not reached. All the more if a storm rages in the Black Sea now, it is a unique blue-emerald hue.
        It reflects the cloudless blue sky covered with the evergreen forests of the Caucasus Mountains.
        The Russian Black Sea is often called " the Russian Riviera" for the mild climate and beautiful views.
        The Caucasus Mountains reliably protect the coast from the cold and dry winds. There is almost always an affectionate warm weather,
        as if deliberately ordered for relaxation.</string>
